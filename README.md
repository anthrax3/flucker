#Flucker

## Random Github issue assignment

Some days your the dog, other days your the hydrant. Become a flucker today!

Is your manager trying to assign you the insane issues all the time? Tell him to get Flucked!

Don't know what to work on in the morning? Use Flucker!

Of course, when you get the crappy, annoying bug issue...Fluck You!

"This is Flucking awesome" is what the two people who built this say. Quit being a boring conformist at work and be a Flucking mad man!
